# Capsule Wardrobe

## The Concept

A capsule wardrobe consists of a small collection of essential items that work harmoniously together, maximizing outfit combinations while minimizing decision fatigue.

## Core Pieces

- **Basics**: Well-fitting jeans, classic white shirt, neutral sweaters
- **Layering**: Blazers, cardigans, scarves for versatility
- **Footwear**: 3-4 pairs that cover different occasions and comfort needs
- **Outerwear**: Quality coat, casual jacket

## Color Strategy

Choose a cohesive color palette of 2-3 neutrals plus 1-2 accent colors. This ensures everything coordinates naturally.

## Seasonal Transitions

Build your capsule around core pieces that work year-round, then add seasonal items as needed.
