# January 2024 Reflections

## Style Discoveries

This month I focused on:
- Researching [Scandinavian Minimalism](../../topics/home-decor/styles/scandinavian-minimalism.md) for my living room
- Building a [Sustainable Fashion](../../topics/clothing/categories/sustainable-fashion.md) approach

## Insights

There's a beautiful connection between mindful home design and conscious clothing choicesâ€”both involve understanding what truly serves you and letting go of excess.

## Current Projects

Planning a living room refresh using [Scandinavian principles](../../topics/home-decor/styles/scandinavian-minimalism.md) while incorporating some [bohemian textures](../../topics/home-decor/styles/bohemian-chic.md) for warmth.
